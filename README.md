# DailyPlanner
This is a daily planner for a person who has the typical 9-5 schedule. It is used to help people who have a busy schedule ahead of them organize or plan out their day. Each time block allows you to enter and save events, and the app color-codes the time blocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
